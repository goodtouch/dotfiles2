# Dot Files

These are config files to set up a system the way I like it.

# Installation

```bash
git clone git://github.com/goodtouch/dotfiles2 ~/.dotfiles
cd .dotfiles
rake install
```

# Environments

I'm running on Mac OS X and Linux Debian.

# Inspiration

This mainly comes from Ryan Bates Dot Files (http://github.com/ryanb) and from a lot of other sources.
I'll try to list them all here:
